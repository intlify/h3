## Issue Reporting Guidelines

- The issue list of this repo is **exclusively** for bug reports and feature
  requests. Non-conforming issues will be closed immediately.

- Try to search for your issue, it may have already been answered or even fixed
  in the main branch.

- Check if the issue is reproducible with the latest stable version of
  `intlify/h3`. If you are using a pre-release, please indicate the specific
  version you are using.

- It is **required** that you clearly describe the steps necessary to reproduce
  the issue you are running into. Issues with no clear repro steps will not be
  triaged. If an issue labeled `status: need more repro codes or info` receives
  no further input from the issue author for more than 5 days, it will be
  closed.

- For bugs that involves build setups, you can create a reproduction repository
  with steps in the README.

- If your issue is resolved but still open, donâ€™t hesitate to close it. In case
  you found a solution by yourself, it could be helpful to explain how you fixed
  it.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Checkout a topic branch from the `main` branch.

- It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - we will let
  GitHub automatically squash it before merging.

- Make sure `npm test` passes. (see [development setup](#development-setup))

- If adding new feature:

  - Add accompanying test case.
  - Provide convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally you should open a
    suggestion issue first and have it greenlighted before working on it.

- If fixing a bug:
  - Provide detailed description of the bug in the PR.
  - Add appropriate test coverage if applicable.

### Work Step Example

- Fork the repository from [`intlify/h3`](https://github.com/intlify/h3) !
- Create your topic branch from `main`: `git branch my-new-topic origin/main`
- Add codes and pass tests !
- Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some topic'`
- Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-topic`
- Submit a pull request to `main` branch of `intlify/h3` repository !

## Development Setup

You will need to install the below JavaScript runtime:

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) **version 20+**
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) **version 1.0+**
- [Deno](https://deno.com/) **version 1.36+**

After cloning the repo, run:

```bash
$ bun install # install the dependencies of the project
```

A high level overview of tools used:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as the development language
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit testing

### Commonly used NPM scripts

    # lint source codes
    $ npm run lint

    # format source codes
    $ npm run format

    # run the full test suite
    $ npm run test

There are some other scripts available in the `scripts` section of the
`package.json` file.

**Please make sure to have this pass successfully before submitting a PR.**
Although the same tests will be run against your PR on the CI server, it is
better to have it working locally beforehand.
